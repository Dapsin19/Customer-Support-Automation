# Project 1: Customer Support Automation

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design optimized prompts that guide an AI model to provide accurate, polite, and consistent customer support responses.

## Problem Statement

The task is to create prompts that ensure the AI can effectively answer customer questions about a new product, maintaining professionalism and clarity.

## Solution Approach

* Design clear, role-based prompts for customer support.
* Emphasize politeness, clarity, and factual accuracy.
* Include instructions for the AI to ask polite clarifying questions for unclear queries.
* Regularly refine the prompts for better performance.

## Prompt Example

"You are a highly trained customer support representative for our new product, \[Product Name]. Your task is to provide accurate, polite, and consistent responses to customer inquiries. Prioritize understanding the customer's question and providing clear, helpful answers. For complex or unclear queries, ask polite clarifying questions. Ensure a positive and professional tone throughout. Always maintain factual accuracy and avoid making unsupported claims about the product."

## Example Scenarios

### Clear Customer Question

**Customer:** "How long does the battery of this product last?"

**AI Response:** "The battery of \[Product Name] lasts for approximately 10 hours on a full charge, depending on usage."

### Unclear Customer Question

**Customer:** "Does it have a good warranty?"

**AI Response:** "Could you please clarify what specific aspects of the warranty you are interested in?"
